                In 2015, Nintendo debuted its “<i>New 3DS</i>” console. The <i>New 3DS</i> and its trims were the final addition to Nintendo’s DS family. The <i>New 3DS</i> improved heavily on the standard 3DS, similar to how the DSi did with the DS. It massively improved the hardware and processing systems, making the <i>New 3DS</i> capable of running more advanced games in a smoother fashion. The camera systems also took a massive improvement along with the the storage ability. New buttons were added on the 3DS like a “C-stick” and shoulder buttons labeled as (ZR and ZL). These buttons gave games more inputs to work with, allowing for a more extensive and enjoyable gameplay experience. Customers who wanted an upgrade to their 3DS system could buy this, and benefit from the far improved resolution. The <i>New 3DS XL</i> was the larger household intended variation of the <i>New 3DS</i>. It like the many other XL trims before it featured a larger overall size to its standard counterpart. In addition to its various software improvements, it also included far more extensive customization options. Customers could select from a vast array of colors, including Metallic hues and special edition designs. This device lasted until late 2019 when it was taken of the Nintendo website. Nintendo discontinued the <i>New 3DS</i> in 2019 to put more focus into its new console, the Nintendo Switch. In 2020, the whole DS and 3DS family was taken down and its services like Eshop are to be closed in 2023. The <i>New 3DS</i> was a great finale to the Nintendo DS. It gave customers the best hardware, screen resolution, and gaming capability, which ended up getting excellent reception from the public.
