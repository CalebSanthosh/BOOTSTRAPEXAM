                The Nintendo <i>DS</i> was the first member of the Nintendo <i>DS</i> family. It was originally introduced as a side device to nintendo's flagship handheld, the Gameboy Advanced, but with its high demands and flourishing sales, Nintendo decided to make it the successor to the Gameboy Family. It was unique from other consoles with its dual screen display. The two screens worked in sync to provide advanced gameplay capability the Gameboy could not get to. It also featured backwards compatability with Gameboy titles, so it could operate any game the Game boys could. It was simply superior in every way. Since the market demand for handheld consoles was so high, and with a lack of competition at the time, the <i>DS</i> was an instant success and flourished in the market place. Along with its new gimmicks, the <i>DS</i> featured wifi connection. With this, it was able to connect with other <i>DS</i> systems, allowing customers to engage in multiplayer activities. The <i>DS</i> came installed with a camera which allowed for users to take photos of themselves and surroundings. In future years, Nintendo released the <i>DS</i> Lite, a lighter and more efficient <i>DS</i>. This gave players an upgrade to the already beloved <i>DS</i> system. The <i>DS</i> stood strong until 2008 when it was finally suceeded by the Nintendo DSi. To this day the <i>DS</i> is Nintendo's most successful console, and globally, it is second only to Sony's Playstation 2.
