              <p>In 2013, Nintendo released the <i>2DS</i>. The <i>2DS</i> was dubbed as the “entry level 3ds”. It had the same hardware as the 3DS, but deviated with its design, functionality, and price. When the 3DS debuted, one of its major flaws was that its 3D function was considered harmful to kids under the age of 7. Although this claim was later debunked, the public would ridicule Nintendo for its “flawed feature”. This was one of the significant factors which led to its original sales flop. The <i>2DS</i> answered that problem by completely removing the 3D function from the system. The original <i>2DS</i> could still run programs in 3D, but it did not get the gimmick of creating the same visual effects as the 3DS when 3D was activated.  The <i>2DS</i> unorthodox design which lacked the clam shell portability of the prior DS models. Despite that sounding bad, critics seemed to appreciate this change as it supplied more ergonomic comfort and grip to the console. The <i>2DS</i> was so cheap, that in late 2016 it could be picked up for just 80 dollars. This was a complete bargain in comparison to other popular consoles like the Xbox 360 and Play Station 3. The <i>2DS</i> sold alongside the 3DS and was quite a success among younger audiences. In later years of production, a <i>2DS</i> XL model was launched. This rendition featured the beloved clam shell design and gave a marginal size upgrade to the <i>2DS</i>. With this, players could enjoy a much cheaper alternative to the far more expensive 3DS XL. The <i>2DS</i> was among the DS family and was another success for the Nintendo DS lineup. </p>
