              <p>2011 marked the release of the Nintendo <i>3DS</i>. The <i>3DS</i> was the successor and was most known for its 3D capabilities. It had a 3D toggle incorporated into the side of the console. This feature allowed the <i>3DS</i> to create proper 3D visuals out of the screens. The incorporation of 3D gave the <i>3DS</i> a far more extensive library of games which could run with beautiful 3D visuals. In addition to the 3D, the <i>3DS</i> received an upgraded camera and software. Street Pass was another notable feature implemented into the <i>3DS</i>. It allowed the <i>3DS</i> to link with other <i>3DS</i> systems in close proximity. Whenever 2 <i>3DS</i> owners passed by, both <i>3DS</i> systems would track down the other, and add them to a library of characters. This allowed players of the <i>3DS</i> to meet new people easier. The <i>3DS</i> received a revised shop program, known as “Nintendo Eshop”. This system has remained constant in all of Nintendo’s recent consoles, including the Switch. The <i>3DS</i> had backwards compatibility with all the original DS games, and even had access to some of the Gameboy titles through a program known as “Virtual Console”. Although all the new changes sounded so promising, the <i>3DS</i> turned out to be a flop. It’s original price of $250 was not appealing to a lot of its prior customers, so in the summer of 2011, Nintendo dropped the price to $170. 20 Eshop titles would be gifted to customers who bought the <i>3DS</i> earlier in compensation. This price drops significantly boosted <i>3DS</i> sales and brought it up to be another of Nintendo’s most successful consoles. The <i>3DS</i> was one of the biggest steps Nintendo took, and it stayed as Nintendo’s flagship model until 2017. </p>
